                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
                control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
                for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                    objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                    For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                    clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                    objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                    server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                    another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                    server.

                The JavaScript programming language, developed by Netscape, Inc., is
                not part of the Java platform.
            </p>

                JavaScript does not create applets or stand-alone applications. In its
                most common form, JavaScript resides inside HTML documents, and can
                provide levels of interactivity to web pages that are not achievable
                with simple HTML.
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>document.write("Hello World!");</code>
        </pre>
            <p>
                Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP
                scripting language. Java creates applications that run in a virtual
                machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a browser only.
                Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text.
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>class xyz  
            {   
              public static void main(String args[]){   
                 System.out.println("Hello World");   
              }   
            }</code>
        </pre>
            <p>
                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
                common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
                dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
                individual objects.

            <p>
                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
                your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
                alert("Hello " + yourName); 
            }</code>
            <code>greetMe("World");</code></pre>
            <p>
                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                browser!
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables_in_JS">
            <header>Variables in JS</header>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
                The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
                Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
                "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
                (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
                identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
                characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
            <header>Declaring Variables</header>
            <p>JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using var</li>
                <li>Using let</li>
                <li>Using const</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Note: It is considered good programming practice to always declare
                variables before use.
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>var x = 5;
            let y = 6;
            const z = x + y;</code>
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_Scope">
            <header>JavaScript Scope</header>
            <p>Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.</p>
            <p>JavaScript variables have 3 types of scope:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Block scope</li>
                <li>Function scope</li>
                <li>Global scope</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
                These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. Variables
                declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>{ let x = 2; }

            // x can NOT be used here</code>
        </pre>
