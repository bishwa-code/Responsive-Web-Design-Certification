                Tesla differs from many other scientists in his effort to have his
                inventions serve humanity without making a profit. His attempt to
                provide humanity with free electricity harmed his life and career. He
                was not interested in profit and had no business sense. Nikola Tesla
                wanted to provide free electrical energy to humanity.
